My love there's only you in my life
The only thing That's right
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I...I want to share all my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes(Your eyes your eyes)
They tell me how much you care oh yes
You will always be my endless love

Two hearts two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever(Woo oh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
My love(Woo love)
I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind(Woh you know I don't mind)
'Cause you
You mean the world to me oh
I know I've found in you(I know I've found in you)
My endless love

Woo Woo
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bom bom bom bom bom
Woo and love(Woo love)
I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind(Woh you know I don't mind)
And yes(And yes)
You'll be the ony one
('Cause no one can deny)No one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
(My love)My love my love
My endless love
