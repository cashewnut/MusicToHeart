There was a time
I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home
I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone
Now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs
From the places where I was born
Upon a hill across a blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!

"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!
There was a time
I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world
I thought I'd never lose her out of sight
We were so young
I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs
Reminding me of a friend
Upon a hill across a blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!
Oh, oh, oh!
See heaven's got a plan for you
"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!
Oh, oh, oh!
Yeah!
