Cool fog in the morning
Like cotton on the trees
Quiet enough to hear a song
In the humming of the bees
Floating out from the highway
Saying,come on up my way
Through the tall grass in the valley
Where the earth and Heaven meet
Won't you come on up to Blue Mountain
Above the clouds and busy crowds
It's where you wanna be
Won't you come on up to Blue Mountain
Where the time crawls and the water falls
Blue Mountain majesty
Send a postcard to your sweetheart
Take a picture by the sign
See all the way to seven states
And the coast if the weather's right
It's always right, it's paradise
It's like you've never seen
Take a nap under a hickory
And wake up in a dream
Won't you come on up to Blue Mountain
Above the clouds and busy crowds
You swear you'll never leave
Won't you come on up to Blue Mountain
Where the time crawls and the water falls
Blue Mountain majesty
Won't you come on up
Won't you come on up
Won't you come on up
To Blue Mountain
Where the time crawls and the water falls
Blue Mountain majesty
Where the time crawls and the water falls
Blue Mountain majesty
Where the time crawls and the water falls
Blue Mountain majesty
