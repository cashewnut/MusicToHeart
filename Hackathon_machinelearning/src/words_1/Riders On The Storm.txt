Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road

Yes, on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
