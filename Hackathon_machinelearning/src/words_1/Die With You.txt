I don't have a reason to cry
And I have every reason to smile
I don't have a reason to lie
When you’re already reading my mind
And I don’t have a reason to be, if I can’t be with you
And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can’t sing your song
No, I don’t need hands if I don’t get to keep you warm
And I don’t really need myself, if I don't need you
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I could see with you
And I live so I can die with you
And I don’t really need these fingers, if I don’t get to touch your spine
Well, I don’t need these legs, if I ain’t walking by your side
And I don’t really need to be if I can’t be with you
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I could see with you
And I live so I can die with you
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can
I live so I can， live so I can die with you
